# DCO is missing

If you are reading this, then you want to contribute to one of the source{d}'s projects.
That's awesome and very respectable üëç.
However, this also means that you probably have not added the "signed-off-by" signature to one or more of your commits in the pull request.

Before we move on, please read [what is the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://github.com/probot/dco#how-it-works).

You may now have a fair question: why does source{d} enforce the DCO? There are two key reasons:

  1. By signing off the contribution, you are certifying it is either your intellectual property or a valid contribution given its respective open source license origin.
  2. It follows that your contribution is, by default if valid, considered your intellectual property in countries such the United States.
  So you could ask the project maintainer to remove one (or more) of your contributions in the future.
  This may get very complicated as the project grows larger and well-known: imagine rewriting the Git history for everybody!

Thus, the DCO works as a sort of an insurance against such cases.

This manual should help you to add the required `Signed-off-by: Your Name <name@email.com>` to your commits in the pull request.

## How To Add Sign-Offs

### Option #1: Amend Single Commit

If there is only a single commit in your pull request, adding the signature is as simple as:

```bash
git commit --amend --no-edit --signoff
git push -f origin <your branch here, probably "master">
```

You can always squash several commits together; see: [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5189560/squash-my-last-x-commits-together-using-git).

### Option #2: Interactive Rebase

If there is more than one commit in your pull requests, you can do an interactive rebase with message editing:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD^^
```

Write `^` as many times as there are commits in your pull request.
A text will open; ensure that there are only your recent commits listed there.
Otherwise, exit the file and repeat the rebase command with the correct number of `^`.

Now, mark all the commits with "reword" or "r". The rebase process will stop at each of your commits.

Execute as many times as you are asked to:

```bash
git commit --amend --no-edit --signoff
git rebase --continue
```

Then, force push:

```bash
git push -f origin <your branch here, probably "master">
```

### Option #3: Git-averse

Git is sometimes frustrating, and you may want to keep distance from it sometimes, for safety.
For now:

  1. Copy the modified files to a backup directory;
  2. Clone the repository again;
  3. Overwrite the old file copies with the modified versions.

Then, execute:

```bash
git commit -a --signoff
git push -f origin <your branch here, probably "master">
```

## How to prevent this in the future?

Commit with `--signoff`; alternatively, create a `commit-msg` hook.
Write `.git/hooks/commit-msg` with

```bash
#!/bin/sh
SIGNATURE="Signed-off-by: `git config --global --get user.name` <`git config --global --get user.email`>"
grep -qs "^${SIGNATURE}" "$1" || echo "\n${SIGNATURE}" >> "$1"
```

You need to do this for each repository independently.
